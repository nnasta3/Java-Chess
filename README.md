# Java-Chess
### Nicholas Nasta
This is a terminal based version of chess implemented in Java. 
Input: When it is your turn, you enter the location of the piece you want to move, and where you want to move it, for example if it was white's turn...
White Turn: a2 a4
And this would move the pawn at a2 to position a4

This version of chess implements castling, en passant, check, and checkmate.
